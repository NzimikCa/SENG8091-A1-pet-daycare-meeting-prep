# Pet Daycare System - Client Meeting Preparation

## Project Context
- **Client**: Pet Daycare Business
- **Date**: September 26, 2025
- **Purpose**: Pre-meeting analysis and question preparation

## Problem Statement
Based on initial interviews, the following pain points were identified:

- **Owners**: Frustrated because onboarding new employees takes at least 3 months
- **Employees**: Frustrated because the process of onboarding a new client is complicated. Each individual employee also has their own "flavour" when processing the incoming client
- **Customers**: Frustrated because the onboarding flow is difficult to follow
